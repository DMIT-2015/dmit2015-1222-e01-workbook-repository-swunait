 *
 * This dataset represents the centre points of each Zone or Operational Area where Photo Enforcement is "scheduled" to be conducted.
 * An enforcement unit can be found anywhere along the area of the Zone.
 * An enforcement unit may not be able to operate at the specified zone and subsequently move to a zone that is not scheduled for enforcement.
 * The centre points are extracted for mapping purposes only and are not intended to imply or suggest that is where the Photo Enforcement is being conducted.
 * Designated Zones are continuously reviewed, revised, added, removed and otherwise updated in accordance to the guidelines for establishing a Zone for photo enforcement.
 * Automated enforcement is expected to be operating at the locations indicated.
 * Please be advised that automated enforcement may be used at other locations within Edmonton as well.
 * Locations selected for enforcement may be removed or added as determined by weather, road conditions, roadway closures or construction, equipment issues or other unforeseen circumstances.
 * Each enforcement site has one or more reasons for why enforcement is taking place. The list of reasons are:
 * a) Areas or intersections where conventional enforcement is unsafe or ineffective;
 * b) Areas or intersections with an identifiable, documented history of collisions;
 * c) Areas or intersections with an identifiable, documented history of speeding problems;
 * d) Intersections with an identifiable, documented history of offences;
 * e) Intersections near schools, post-secondary institutions, or other areas with high pedestrian volumes;
 * f) School and playground zones or areas;
 * g) Construction zones; or
 * h) Areas where the public or a community has expressed concerns related to speeding.
 *
 * Please refer to the FAQ the City has available in regards to Photo Enforcement.
